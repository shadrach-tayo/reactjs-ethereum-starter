## Getting Started

This project uses npm Workspaces, so you'll need npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadrach-tayo/reactjs-ethereum-starter.git
cd reactjs-ethereum-starter

npm install

# Start up the Hardhat Network
npm chain
```

Here we just install the npm project's dependencies, and by running `npm chain` we spin up an instance of Hardhat Network that you can connect to using MetaMask. In a different terminal in the same directory, run:

```bash
npm deploy
```

This will deploy the contract to Hardhat Network. After this completes run:

```bash
npm dev
```

This will start up the Next.js development server and your site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

To interact with the local contract, be sure to switch your MetaMask Network to `Localhost 8545`
